# Adrift in Space

## Description
A space themed Sort the Court. You are the captain of an adrift space ship trying to survive and get back to your home planet.

Maybe instead of you being a captain you are an AI.

## 3 supplies
- Crew
- Fuel
- Food

There is no need for water because all of the water gets recycled on the space ship.

## How 3 supplies interact
- Food goes down over time.
- Crew stays the same if you have Food.
- If no Food then Crew goes down over time.
- Fuel goes down over time and gets you closer to home.
- If Fuel is 0 you don't get closer to home. Stay in the same spot.

## How you loose
When you have 0 Crew.

## How you win
You get back to your home planet.
